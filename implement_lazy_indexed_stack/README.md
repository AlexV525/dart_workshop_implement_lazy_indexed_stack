# Implement `LazyIndexedStack`

> Estimate total time to take the workshop: 38 minutes

Welcome to the Flutter workshop `LazyIndexedStack`
written by [Alex Li](https://github.com/AlexV525) ! ðŸ’™

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `IndexedStack` in your code,
and implement a lazy-loading `LazyIndexedStack` to lazily build children
only when they are first activated.

> The _lazily build_ here indicates the processes of `Widget`s inflating `Element`s are lazy.

This workshop is intended for people who are already
familiar with building simple Flutter apps.
Check out to get started with Flutter if this is your first time using it.
