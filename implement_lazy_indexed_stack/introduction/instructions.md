# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory `LazyIndexedStack` workshop for Flutter! ðŸ‘‹

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `IndexedStack` in your code, and
create a lazy-loading `LazyIndexedStack` that builds children on-demand only
when they're first activated.

This workshop is best for folks already familiar with building simple
Flutter applications. If this is your first time using Flutter, then
check out **[Writing Your First Flutter App](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)**
to get started using Flutter.

## What is `IndexedStack`?

`IndexedStack` is a `Stack` that
shows a single child from a list of children.
The displayed child is the one with the given _index_.
When the _index_ is null, then nothing is displayed.

## When should I use `IndexedStack`?

`IndexedStack` perfectly suit for the following use cases:

  - If you have multiple pages and want to switch between them using bottom
    navigation.
  - When you have a sequence of widgets you need to display.

## What's next?

Throughout this workshop, you'll convert the `IndexedStack`
into a more efficient, lazy loading `LazyIndexedStack`.
This allows you to save performance cost at the first place.
Move on to the next step to begin!
